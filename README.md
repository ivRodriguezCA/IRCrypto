# IRCrypto - iOS Crypto library

#### **Warning: I'm not a cryptographer, this library has not been reviewed by a crypto expert (and may never happen), use at your own risk**

## Overview
#### IRCrypto aims to provide the following:
- Cryptographic Key Derivation (using PBKDF2 with 10,000 rounds) from a String
- Symmetric AES Key generation (128, 256, 512 bits)
- Asymmetric RSA Key generation (1024, 2048 and 4096 bits)
- Asymmetric EC Key generation (256, 384 and 521 bits) ([Read More][ec-type])
- Data hashing (using SHA256)
- Data signing (using HMAC - SHA256 + 256 bit key)
- Symmetric Encryption (AES in CBC mode)
- Asymmetric Encryption (RSA)
- Authenticated Encryption using the Encrypt-then-MAC scheme (AES in CBC mode and HMAC) [RNCryptor Data Format v3]
- Public Key Encryption with Authenticated Encryption (RSA + AES in CBC mode and HMAC) [RNCryptor Data Format v3]

#### You can also:
- Save the generated keys (AES, RSA, EC) in the Keychain and protect them with TouchID and/or a user generated password
- Generate an asymmetric key pair (RSA) for signing data, where the private key will never be returned and just used for singning directly from the Secure Enclave

### Version
0.9.5

### Import

#### Cocoapods
```sh
pod "IRCrypto"
```
Then just import the IRCrypto header
```Objc
#import <IRCrypto/IRCryptoHeader.h>
```

#### Framework
- Clone the repo:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/ivRodriguezCA/IRCrypto
```
- Drag and drop the IRCrypto project on your project or
- Select the `Build Framework` scheme and build the project (`âŒ˜ + b`), this is going to generate a `IRCrypto.framework` framework in your desktop directory.

### Usage
Create an instance of `IRCrypto` and configure it with options (read more about the options on the [`IRPublicConstants` header][IRPublicConstants-header]). When you use the default options IRCrypto is going to generate a RSA key pair (2048 bits) an AES key (256 bits) and a signing RSA key pair (the private key will never leave the secure enclave) and a HMAC key (256 bits). All these keys are going to be saved in the Keychain using the TouchID protection. (**Note: if the device doesn't support TouchID an `Application Password` is required to protect these keys. Use the `kIRAppPasswordKey` option key when creating your IRCrypto instance.**)
- For the default uptions:
```Objc
- (void)someMethod {
	IRCrypto *crypto = [IRCrypto new];
}
```
- When the device doesn't support TouchID:
```Objc
- (BOOL)supportsTouchID {
    LAContext *context = [LAContext new];
    NSError *error = nil;

    return [context canEvaluatePolicy:LAPolicyDeviceOwnerAuthenticationWithBiometrics error:&error];
}
- (void)someMethod {
  kIRKeyProtection protection = [self supportsTouchID] ? kIRKeyProtectionTouchID : kIRKeyProtectionPassword;
  NSDictionary *options = @{
                              kIRAsymmetricEncryptionProtectionKey:@(protection),
                              kIRSymmetricEncryptionProtectionKey:@(protection),
                              kIRHMACProtectionKey:@(protection),
                              kIRAppPasswordKey: @"my-secret-password"
                            };
  IRCrypto *crypto = [[IRCrypto alloc] initWithOptions:options];
}
```
- For using IRCrypto just to encrypt/decrypt using your own Keys (or secret password):
```Objc
- (void)someMethod {
	IRCrypto *crypto = [[IRCrypto alloc] initWithOptions:@{kIREncryptionOptionsKey:@(kEncryptionOptionsNone)}];
}
```

### Generating Cryptographic keys
IRCrypto helps you generate Cryptographic keys like AES and HMAC keys.

### Encrypting and Decrypting
Encryption should provide confidentiality and integrity, this is why we need to use schemes like [Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD)][Authenticated-Encryption]. IRCrypto uses the [Advance Encryption Standard][Advanced-Encryption-Standard] (AES) in [Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)][Cipher-Block-Chaining] mode of operation for confidentiality and [Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC)][Hash-Based-Message-Authentication-Code] for integrity. IRCrypto uses the [RNCryptor File Format v3][RNCryptor-File-Format-v3] to package a header, the ciphertext and the MAC.

#### AEAD Encryption
If you use the default options you can simply call the `aeEncryptData:completion:failure:` method with your plaintext data. You **don't** need to save the *IV* as it is part of the RNCryptor Data Format:
```Objc
- (void)someAuthenticatedEncryptionMethod {
    IRCrypto *crypto = ...
    NSData *plaintext = ...
    [crypto aeEncryptData:plaintext
               completion:^(NSData *cipherData, NSData *iv, NSData *encryptionSalt, NSData *hmacSalt) {
                  // encryptionSalt and hmacSalt will be nil
                  // iv is returned but could be ignored
                  // Do something cipherData
               } 
               failure:^(NSError *error) {
                  // Handle error
               }
    ];
}
```
You can also encrypt with your own keys using the `aeEncryptData:symmetricKey:hmacKey:completion:failure:` method (it is recommended to use 2 different keys, 1 for AES and 1 for HMAC). You **don't** need to save the *IV* as it is part of the RNCryptor Data Format:
```Objc
- (void)someAuthenticatedEncryptionMethod {
    IRCrypto *crypto = ...
    NSData *plaintext = ...
    NSData *aesKey = ... // This should be a 256 bit random key
    NSData *hmacKey = ... // This should be a 256 bit random key
    [crypto aeEncryptData:plaintext
             symmetricKey:aesKey
                  hmacKey:hmacKey
               completion:^(NSData *cipherData, NSData *iv, NSData *encryptionSalt, NSData *hmacSalt) {
                  // encryptionSalt and hmacSalt will be nil
                  // iv is returned but could be ignored
                  // Do something cipherData
               } 
               failure:^(NSError *error) {
                  // Handle error
               }
    ];
}
```
If you don't want to generate random keys, you can use a simple text password with the `aeEncryptData:password:completion:failure:` method. You **don't** need to save the `encryptionSalt` nor the `hmacSalt` as they are part of the RNCryptor Data Format):
```Objc
- (void)someAuthenticatedEncryptionMethod {
    IRCrypto *crypto = ...
    NSData *plaintext = ...
    NSString *password = ... // This can be a string of any length
    [crypto aeEncryptData:plaintext
                 password:password
               completion:^(NSData *cipherData, NSData *iv, NSData *encryptionSalt, NSData *hmacSalt) {
                  // iv, encryptionSalt and hmacSalt are returned but could be ignored
                  // Do something with cipherData *and* encryptionSalt *and* hmacSalt
               } 
               failure:^(NSError *error) {
                  // Handle error
               }
    ];
}
```
#### AEAD Decryption
Since IRCryptor uses the RNCryptor File Format, most of the information for decryption is available there, IRCryptor only needs the corresponding decryption keys. This alleviates the headache of saving IVs and Salts.

If you use the default options you can simply call the `aeDecryptData:completion:failure:` method with your ciphertext:
```Objc
- (void)someAuthenticatedDecryptionMethod {
    IRCrypto *crypto = ...
    NSData *ciphertext = ...
    [crypto aeDecryptData:ciphertext
               completion:^(NSData *decryptedData) {
                  // Do something with decryptedData
               } 
               failure:^(NSError *error) {
                  // Handle error
               }
    ];
}
```
Decrypting with your own keys using the `aeDecryptData:symmetricKey:hmacKey:completion:failure:` method:
```Objc
- (void)someAuthenticatedDecryptionMethod {
    IRCrypto *crypto = ...
    NSData *ciphertext = ...
    NSData *aesKey = ... // This should be a 256 bit random key
    NSData *hmacKey = ... // This should be a 256 bit random key
    [crypto aeDecryptData:ciphertext
             symmetricKey:aesKey
                  hmacKey:hmacKey
               completion:^(NSData *decryptedData) {
                  // Do something with decryptedData
               } 
               failure:^(NSError *error) {
                  // Handle error
               }
    ];
}
```

And of course you can decrypt using a password with the `aeDecryptData:password:completion:failure:` method:
```Objc
- (void)someAuthenticatedDecryptionMethod {
    IRCrypto *crypto = ...
    NSData *ciphertext = ...
    NSString *password = ... // This can be a string of any length
    [crypto aeDecryptData:ciphertext
                 password:password
               completion:^(NSData *decryptedData) {
                  // Do something with decryptedData
               } 
               failure:^(NSError *error) {
                  // Handle error
               }
    ];
}
```

IRCrypto also provides straightforward Encryption and Decryption methods using AES in CBC Mode. Note that these methods provide confidentiality but not integrity against active attacks. Also while using this methods you need to remember to save the correspongind IVs and Salts.
#### Symmetric Encryption
If you use the default options you can simply call the `encryptData:completion:failure:` method with your plaintext data (remember to save the returned IV for decryption):
```Objc
- (void)someEncryptionMethod {
	IRCrypto *crypto = ...
	NSData *plaintext = ...
	[crypto encryptData:plaintext
             completion:^(NSData *cipherData, NSData *iv, NSData *salt) {
             	// Salt will be nil
             	// Do something with iv and cipherData
             } 
             failure:^(NSError *error) {
             	// Handle error
             }
    ];
}
```
You can also encrypt with your own key using the `encryptData:withKey:completion:failure:` method:
```Objc
- (void)someEncryptionMethod {
	IRCrypto *crypto = ...
	NSData *plaintext = ...
	NSData *key = ... // This should be a 256 bit random key
	[crypto encryptData:plaintext
                withKey:key
             completion:^(NSData *cipherData, NSData *iv, NSData *salt) {
             	// Salt will be nil
             	// Do something with iv and cipherData
             } 
             failure:^(NSError *error) {
             	// Handle error
             }
    ];
}
```

Same as with AEAD, if you don't want to generate a random key, you can use a simple text password with the `encryptData:withPassword:completion:failure:` method (be aware of the fact that in this case you also need to save the `salt` for decryption):
```Objc
- (void)someEncryptionMethod {
	IRCrypto *crypto = ...
	NSData *plaintext = ...
	NSString *password = ... // This can be a string of any length
	[crypto encryptData:plaintext
           withPassword:password
             completion:^(NSData *cipherData, NSData *iv, NSData *salt) {
             	// Note that salt will *not* be nil
             	// Do something with iv, cipherData *and* salt
             } 
             failure:^(NSError *error) {
             	// Handle error
             }
    ];
}
```

#### Symmetric Decryption
If you use the default options you can simply call the `decryptData:iv:completion:failure:` method with your ciphertext and the iv returned during encryption:
```Objc
- (void)someDecryptionMethod {
	IRCrypto *crypto = ...
	NSData *ciphertext = ...
	NSData *iv = ... // The iv returned after encryption
	[crypto decryptData:ciphertext
					 iv:iv
             completion:^(NSData *decryptedData) {
             	// Do something with decryptedData
             } 
             failure:^(NSError *error) {
             	// Handle error
             }
    ];
}
```
Decrypting with your own key using the `decryptData:withKey:iv:completion:failure:` method:
```Objc
- (void)someDecryptionMethod {
	IRCrypto *crypto = ...
	NSData *ciphertext = ...
	NSData *key = ... // This should be a 256 bit random key
	NSData *iv = ... // The iv returned after encryption
	[crypto decryptData:ciphertext
                withKey:key
                	iv:iv
             completion:^(NSData *decryptedData) {
             	// Do something with decryptedData
             } 
             failure:^(NSError *error) {
             	// Handle error
             }
    ];
}
```

Decrypting using a password with the `decryptData:withPassword:iv:salt:completion:failure:` method:
```Objc
- (void)someDecryptionMethod {
	IRCrypto *crypto = ...
	NSData *ciphertext = ...
	NSString *password = ... // This can be a string of any length
	NSData *iv = ... // The iv returned after encryption
	NSData *salt = ... // The salt returned after encryption
	[crypto decryptData:ciphertext
           withPassword:password
           			 iv:iv
           		   salt:salt
             completion:^(NSData *decryptedData) {
             	// Do something with decryptedData
             } 
             failure:^(NSError *error) {
             	// Handle error
             }
    ];
}
```

### Tests
Tests are written in Objective-c using the XCTest Framework, select the `IRCrypto` scheme and `âŒ˜ + u`.

### Development

Want to contribute? Great!

Again, this is a learning experiment, if you find issues or want to add more features I'll be happy to merge your pull requests :)

### Todos

 - Receive all the hate from the crypto experts for creating this library in the first place
 - Get some crypto experts to look at this code
 - Iterate on the first 2 points ;)
 - Error handling
 - Add RSA and EC key pair enum for key sizes (right now is 2048 for RSA and 256 for EC)
 - Incremental Symmetric Encryption
 - Add Documentation
 - Add Data Signing functionality to `IRCrypto`
 - Finish the export public key functionality
 - Add a CHANGELOG file
 - Implement Public Key Encryption with Authenticated Encryption

## Why?
On any crypto course the first thing you **always** learn is: **DO NOT IMPLEMENT YOUR OWN CRYPTO**, although I'm trying my best to use crypto correctly and using all best practices, there are probably issues within this library. Why am I creating this library then? Short answer: I want to learn. Although this library **is not intended to be used in real world applications** (*maybe in the future?*), I learned a lot implementing it, insted of just understanding the theory behind these cryptographic concepts, I also wanted to experiment with them with real code. That being said, if you find any issues please let me know, I'll fix them and we can all learn from it.
